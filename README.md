choco install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
scoop install ffmpeg
```

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/liveTranslation_openai-whisper.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
```bash
cd liveTranslation_openai-whisper`
```

3. Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration
Set up your OpenAI API key in `config.yaml`:

1. Rename `config.yaml.default` to `config.yaml`

2. Enter your OpenAI API key in the `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
openai:
  api_key: "Your-OpenAI-API-Key"
```

## Args
Execute with `python main.py` and the following optional flags:
- `-d <seconds>`: Set the duration for audio capture.
- `-f <filename.wav>`: Translate from an existing audio file.
- `-c <language>`: Choose a specific language or use `Smart Select` for automatic detection.
- `-t`: Enable continuous translation mode. (No Spacebar toggle record)
- `-v <voice_name>`: Activate text-to-speech for the translated text.


### Usage Examples

- 4-second live translation in Spanish with toggle recording
```bash
python main.py -d 4 -c Spanish
```

---

- 10-second live translation in continuous mode
```bash
python main.py -d 10 -t
```

---

- Translate an existing audio file with Shimmer's voice
```bash
